#Task-03

This project is part of a machine learning internship task under SkillCraftTechnology, where I implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs.
The main objective was to build a traditional machine learning model (SVM) that can distinguish between cat and dog images by transforming pixel data into numerical features and training the classifier accordingly.
